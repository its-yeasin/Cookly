- `POST /api/recipes/generate` - Generate recipes from ingredients
- `GET /api/recipes` - Browse recipes
- `POST /api/recipes/search-by-ingredients` - Search by ingredients
- And more... (see [Backend Documentation](https://github.com/its-yeasin/Cookly-Backend))

### App Configuration

Update `lib/config.ts` to customize:

- API base URL and timeout
- Default servings and max ingredients
- Storage keys and pagination settings
